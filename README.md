Storage Unit Calculator for pro-rated fees

This is a calculator that I made for a business that my wife worked at. The problem was that their storage unit software wouldn't calculate the pro-rate cost that a customer would need to pay on the 1st day that they rented their storage unit. Depending on the size of the storage unit and the day of the month when a customer would rent the stoage unit, the total owed would change. If it was the 13th of the month or later, the following months rent was also added onto the initial payment. The first payment would also include a fixed $15.00 charge that would be added to the total.
